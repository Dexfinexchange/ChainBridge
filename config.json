*
* configuration file for the bridge
* generally, bridges are two-sided: home and foreign.
* however, we want this bridge to have multiple sides,
* so that a user can specify which chain they want to transfer
* their fuel or tokens to.
* instead of home and foreign, we will have chain 1, chain 2, 
* chain 3, ... etc.
